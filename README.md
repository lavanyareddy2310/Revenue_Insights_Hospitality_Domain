# Overview:
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. However, due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. As a strategic initiative, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wants to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights.


# Problem Statement:
The revenue management team has decided to hire a third-party service provider to gain insights from their historical data.


# Key Insights:
1️⃣ Analyzing the weekday and weekend table for ADR, RevPAR, and Occupancy %, it can be concluded that the hotels are not adjusting prices between weekdays and weekends. There is a potential opportunity to generate additional revenue by adjusting prices based on the day of the week, a strategy that many of the hotels have yet to adopt.

2️⃣ The fluctuation in ADR remains consistent over time, which is directly related to pricing. Occupancy % is seen to increase marginally, and RevPAR varies linearly with Occupancy %. This shows that revenue growth over time is primarily driven by increases in occupancy %, while pricing for most hotels remains almost constant. This presents an opportunity to increase revenue through pricing strategies.

3️⃣ Occupancy % is directly proportional to average hotel ratings and inversely proportional to pricing. Hotels with lower occupancy rates should focus on improving their ratings.

4️⃣ Realization reflects the conversion rate from booking to check-in. If realization is low, it could indicate that customers are dissatisfied with the actual appearance of the hotel compared to how it was portrayed online.
